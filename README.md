- The Riverine Simulation Environment has only been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 22.04.

- To download all files in this repo, including Unity Riverine Environments and VAE model, please use [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) after clone

    `git lfs pull`

- The environments can also be downloaded solely from Google Drive [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WJxrdJ-zutyivMwX9l2zxkW3kB5BTTz5/view?usp=sharing), and the VAE model from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SVU3p5wbGQnQs7U3qp7Gz0eCdo7YrYGh/view?usp=sharing), then replace folder 'riverine_simulation/unity_riverine_envs' and file 'encoder/models/vae-sim-rgb-all.pth' respectively.
